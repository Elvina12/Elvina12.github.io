## Professional Self-Assessment
Before starting this journey in SNHU learning computer science program, I was working as a secretary in one of the Healthcare organizations. Getting Bachelor’s degree was always on my list. I was attending the university back in Russia where I am from, but I wanted to learn computer science specifically. After I started the computer science degree I was able to get a job as IT Analyst at the help desk for the same healthcare organization. Both the knowledge from the degree program and my work experience helped me to get my next step, and after a year I became an Application Coordinator for Hospital Billing and was involved in an 18-month EMR (electronic medical record) project. This was both challenging and interesting to me. Working and taking classes at the same time was very hard, but I did learn a lot. ITIL and SCRUM classes helped me to acquaint myself with my job a lot faster. My favorite classes were classes that involved computer coding and data analyses. While I couldn’t use computer coding at my work I tried to practice and master my skill during the courses. I did get a chance to use the data analysis at work, as reporting is a big part of billing and revenue cycle management. At first data, analysis seemed very boring, but then I realized how data analyses can help predict the future and learned to like it. The most fascinating to me was that data analysis is everywhere. Any field uses data analyses to some extent, and if know how to read and interpret the data, they know their future steps. The last class I’m taking in SNHU is the Computer Science Capstone, CS-499. It makes me both sad and happy. I have learned a lot from classes here at SNHU. I was already able to achieve so much in my career because of it. My horizon had broadened from classes, I have learned what aspects of Computer Science I want to perceive. Looking back to the beginning of this journey, I understand how much had changed, including my view of my future career. I want to say a big thank you to my teachers and advisors, they believed in me and I did it!
